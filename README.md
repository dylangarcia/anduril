## Why?

As each Twitch community grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to manage. The chat in particular can become hard to follow, and important messages quickly get lost in the deluge of messages. Anduril adds features to the Twitch user interface designed to help streamers and moderators keep up!

No guarantees that features will always work - when Twitch makes updates, this extension may break. If you find any bugs, please open an issue.

## Installation

Anduril is currently only available as a Chrome extension.
